Say you're working on your code in Git and something didn't go as planned. So now you need to revert your last commit. How do you do it? Let's find out!

There are two possible ways to undo your last commit. We'll look at both of them in this article.

The revert command The revert command will create a commit that reverts the changes of the commit being targeted. You can use it to revert the last commit like this:

git revert

You can find the name of the commit you want to revert using git log. The first commit that's described there is the last commit created. Then you can copy from there the alphanumerical name and use that in the revert command.

revert instead creates a new commit that undoes the changes, so if the commit to revert has already been pushed to a shared repository, it is best to use revert as it doesn't overwrite commit history.
